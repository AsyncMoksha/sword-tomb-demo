## Sword Tomb (demo)
===

This is a demo for a new way of Object Manipulation in Virtual Reality environment.

Here's a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhuoGrvPrkg&feature=youtu.be) that I made.

You can play this playable demo [here](http://xinglab.com/games/sword_tomb/sword_tomb.html).


###Instructions:
1.  Play the game, you'll find yourself facing 3 swords and a gunsight in the middle of the screen

2. Fire to the swords you want to take a closer look at by beaming to them (left click), the selected ones would float up; If you changed your mind and don't want it, beam to it again and it would drop down

3. Press "Q" key on your keyboard to summon them, now the selected swords would orbit around you for you to take a closer look at in order to choose

4. Beam to the sword you choose to use, it will jump to your hand, the rest would disappear (well, pretend this is a magic cave and these swords are fairy swords, so you only have one chance)

5. Now you can quit the game, there's nothing else you can do other than walking around with your newly acquired sword
